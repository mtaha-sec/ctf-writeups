\# CTF Write-Ups



Simple collection of CTF solution write-ups organized by challenge type.



\## Structure



```

ctf-writeups/

&nbsp; ├─ HackTheBox/

```



\## How to use



\* Browse the folders to find write-ups.

\* Each write-up should be a markdown file (`.md`) with steps, commands, and final flags or outcomes.



\## Contributing



\* Add new write-ups as markdown files in the correct folder.

\* Use clear filenames and include a short summary at the top of each file.



\## Notes



\* Empty folders may contain a `.gitkeep` placeholder so Git tracks them.

\* Keep sensitive data and live flags out of public repos.
