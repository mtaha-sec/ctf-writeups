# CTF Write-Ups

This repository contains my Capture The Flag (CTF) write-ups organized by challenge type.  
Each write-up explains the challenge, tools used, and solution steps.

## How to Use

- Browse folders to find write-ups.  
- Each write-up is a markdown file with steps and notes.  

## Contributing

- Add new write-ups as markdown files in the correct folder.  
- Avoid sharing real flags or sensitive info.
## NB

Empty folders don’t show up on GitHub by default. To keep folder structure visible, we add a hidden file named `.gitkeep` inside empty folders.

I practice offensive security as a passion to strengthen my hacker mindset, which helps me identify weaknesses, prevent attacks, and better protect cloud environments.
